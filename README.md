# RSFaultZ 
RSFaultZ is a MATLAB app for performing quasi-dynamic rupture simulations using rate and state friction. Simulations can be set up and run without any need to view or alter any code; these tasks can be performed using the graphical user interface.

To start the app, type >> RSFaultZ in the MATLAB command window.

RSFaultZ requires the hm-toolbox to run simulations: https://github.com/numpi/hm-toolbox

Codes for running the BP1-QD and BP3-QD benchmarks can be found in the benchmarks folder.
