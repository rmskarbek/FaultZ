The files in this folder can be used to run the community code benchmark problem BP3-QD, defined in Erickson et al. (2023).

The script BP3QD_Plots.m will automatically set up and run the problem in RSFaultZ for: (1) a thrust fault with 60 deg dip, and (2) normal fault with 30 deg dip. BP3QD_Plots.m calls Run_BP3QD.m which sets up the simulations. Then BP3QD_Plots.m runs the simulation and calls BP3QD_OnFault.m, which extracts on-fault simulation data at specified locations. Finally, BP3QD_Plots.m calls BP3QD_Displacements.m, which computes displacemts at specified locations off of the fault.

For comparison with the output from RSFaultZ, this folder also contains data from the FDRA code, downloaded from  https://strike.scec.org/cvws/cgi-bin/seas.cgi
